# UnityFishingMinigame
Package and Sample Project of a Stardew Valley fishing minigame I wrote for Unity.

This is a Unity package and example project that you can use to put a fishing mingame into any of your projects. 
It uses a CSV file which you can easily export from Google Sheets or Excel to import information about the fish in the game, 
including Name, Price and their Sprite ID. The minigame is mostly self contained and it's just a matter of dragging and 
dropping the player prefab into your scene.
